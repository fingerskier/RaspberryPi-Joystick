# RaspberryPi-Joystick

The goal of this project is to create a virtual USB HID joystick using Raspberry Pi which can convert BT mice/keyboard or USB mice/keyboard to joystick HID actions.

This Raspberry Pi joystick converter can be used to operate Xbox Adaptive Controller or NS console as practical use cases.

A RaspberryPi 4B or a raspberry pi zero W can be used for this project.

The new versions of raspberry pi zero W come with USB OTG and bluetooth chip which makes it possible to use Bluetooth HID devices as well as USB HID.

A RaspberryPi 4B can also be used instead of a Raspberry pi zero W.

This project is in development process at the moment.

We now go over the hardware and software requirements.
